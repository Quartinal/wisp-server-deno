### wisp-server-deno
a deno implementation of wisp-server-node with slight modifications (not sure if this works but i'll just publish it so i can later reference it)

### to run (assuming you have deno installed globally):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quartinal/wisp-server-deno && deno run --allow-all examples/start.ts
```
